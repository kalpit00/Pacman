# Pacman AI Projects

This directory contains four major projects that implement various AI concepts using the Pacman environment:

## 1. Search (`search/`)
Implementation of fundamental search algorithms to help Pacman find paths through his maze world:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search
- A* Search
- Various heuristic functions

## 2. Multi-Agent Search (`multiagent/`)
Implementation of adversarial and stochastic search algorithms:
- Minimax
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Expectimax
- Evaluation Functions
- Multi-agent scenarios with ghosts

## 3. Reinforcement Learning (`reinforcement/`)
Implementation of model-based and model-free learning algorithms:
- Value Iteration
- Q-Learning
- Approximate Q-Learning
- State-Action Reward-State-Action (SARSA)
- Policies and Value Functions

## 4. Probabilistic Inference (`tracking/`)
Implementation of probabilistic inference algorithms:
- Hidden Markov Models
- Particle Filtering
- Bayesian Networks
- State Estimation
- Ghost Hunting with Partially Observable States

Each project directory contains its own README with specific instructions and implementation details.
